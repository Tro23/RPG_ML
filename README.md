# Role Playing Game to Teach Machine Learning Algorithms to an RL Agent

### Abstract
This research paper presents a proof of concept for a novel approach to teaching machine learning (ML) through a narrative-driven role-playing game (RPG). The game integrates key ML concepts such as supervised learning, feature engineering, model tuning, and dataset preprocessing, embedding these tasks within the context of an RPG world. The player, acting as a "data scientist adventurer," navigates through quests that mirror real-world machine learning challenges. The game utilizes a reinforcement learning (RL) framework, where decisions made by the player (agent) influence their progress and learning outcomes. Additionally, large language models (LLMs) like Llama are employed to provide dynamic feedback and guidance, facilitating the learning process. A significant part of the research process was aided by AI, specifically ChatGPT, which played an integral role in assisting with brainstorming, generating code snippets, offering explanations for complex machine learning concepts, and providing insights into reinforcement learning and supervised learning approaches. The integration of AI tools, specifically ChatGPT allowed for iterative conversations, where the assistant acted as a collaborator to refine hypotheses, solve coding issues, and optimize models efficiently. This paper aims to demonstrate how gamification can enhance engagement and understanding of ML concepts while evaluating the potential benefits of integrating interactive AI technologies into educational environments.
